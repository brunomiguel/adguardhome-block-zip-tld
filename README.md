### Block the new ZIP TLD in AdGuardHome

The cybersecurity community has expressed concerns regarding the new ZIP TLD. You can read about it [here](https://medium.com/@bobbyrsec/the-dangers-of-googles-zip-tld-5e1e675e59a5) and [here](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-zip-domains-spark-debate-among-cybersecurity-experts/). To help you keep those pesky links away from your hardware, I created this list.

The list uses the Adguard syntax, so it may work with uBlock Origin. I haven't tested it, though. If you test it, please report if it worked for you.
